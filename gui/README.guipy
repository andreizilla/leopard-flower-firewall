This is a Python-based frontend for Leopard Flower.
  In order for it to run, the following packages should be installed:
  python2.6
  python-qt
  libqtcore4, libqtgui4

  1. Place all *.py(c) files into the same directory as lpfw.
      Alternatively you can start lpfw with commandline argument --guipy-path= followed by a path of lpfwgui.py
  2. If not already launched, launch lpfw as root from terminal
  3. Issue "lpfw --guipy" as a regular user (not root)
