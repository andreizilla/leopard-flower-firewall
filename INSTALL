    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions apply specifically to Ubuntu 10.10 but are very likely to work on other Linux distributions.

The following packaged must be installed for lpfw daemon to compile:
	libglib2.0-dev
    libnetfilter-queue-dev
    libnetfilter-conntrack-dev
    libcap-dev
The following packaged must be installed for lpfwcli frontend to compile:
    libncursesw5-dev
    optional: zenity(for popup notifications)
The following packaged must be installed for python frontend to compile:
    libpython2.6
    python2.6-dev

!!! Additional packages are required to run lpfw properly, please see README for extra packages and usage info

Navigate into the source folder and type:
mkdir build
cd build
make -C ../ DESTDIR=`pwd`

Now build folder should have files lpfw, lpfwcli, lpfwpygui and folder lpfw-pygui.

  On some systems after typing "make", you may get a warning similar to the one below:
  lpfw.c:1230:32: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘nfq_get_payload’ from
  incompatible pointer type
  /usr/local/include/libnetfilter_queue/libnetfilter_queue.h:107:12: note: expected ‘unsigned char **’ but argument is of type ‘char **’
  This warning can be safely ignored.
