INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions apply specifically to Ubuntu 10.10 but are very likely to work on other Linux distributions.

The following packaged must be installed for lpfw to compile:

libnetfilter-queue-dev
libnetfilter-conntrack-dev
libnfnetlink-dev
libcap-dev
libncurses5-dev (to use ncurses frontend)
optional: zenity(for popup notifications)
libpython2.6
python2.6-dev

These packages are needed for lpfwgui to run

libnetfilter_queue
libnetfilter_conntrack
libqtcore4
libqtgui 4
python (v2.6)
python-qt4

Navigate into the source code folder and run "make"

Additionally you need to compile IPC_wrapper.so which is used by python-based graphical frontend. 
Simply issue make ipcwrapper

lpfw should be placed into the same folder as all the *.py files from gui folder.
Run lpfw as root.
Run lpfw --guipy as regular user. 





Refer to README for instructions on how to use lpfw and technical information.

  On some systems after typing "make", you may get a warning similar to the one below:
  lpfw.c:1230:32: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘nfq_get_payload’ from
  incompatible pointer type
  /usr/local/include/libnetfilter_queue/libnetfilter_queue.h:107:12: note: expected ‘unsigned char **’ but argument is of type ‘char **’
  This warning can be safely ignored.
