INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

These instructions apply specifically to Ubuntu 10.10 but are very likely to work on other Linux distributions.

The following packaged must be installed for lpfw to compile:

libnetfilter-queue-dev
libnfnetlink-dev
libncurses5-dev (to use ncurses frontend)
optional: zenity(for popup notifications)

Navigate into the source code folder and run "make"

Additionally you may want to compile a module IPC_wrapper.so which is used by python-based graphical frontend. This module is shipped in lpfw_frontend_python_*.tar.bz pre-compiled, so usually there is no need to compile it.
It requires: libpython2.6 and python2.6-del
Simply issue make ipcwrapper



Refer to README for instructions on how to use lpfw.
